        <h2>My Italian grandmother makes these every year</h2>
        <p>She is Sicilian and calls them 'cripelli.' It's sort of like a fritter and so yummy. As an alternative, you could also chop up the blossoms and mix them up in the batter and drop by teaspoons into the hot oil.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>â…” cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powde</li>
            <li>3 leaves fresh basil, minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>2 eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>3 cups oil for frying</li>
            <li>12 pumpkin or zucchini blossoms</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, basil and Parmesan cheese. Mix in water and eggs until smooth.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, dip blossoms in the batter to coat, and gently place a few at a time into the hot oil. Fry on each side until crisp and golden. Drain on paper towels.</li>
